#Ria-Generator
##Add Your Project Scaffold
1. You can add your project in the `template` folder.
2. **[Important]**Add `ria-type` field in your `package.json` file. The field is recognized as your **project type**, which can be use with `steel-cli` (steel init -t [type])
3. If needed, you can rename your `taskfile` to `_task-steel.js`, which `steel-cli` can load.
